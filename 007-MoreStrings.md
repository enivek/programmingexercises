# More Strings

## Write a function where, given a string, will return the same string with its non alphabet letters removed.
```javascript

/**
 * Write a function where, given a string, will return the same string with its non alphabet letters removed. This means
 * all characters that are not A, B, C ... Z and a, b, c ... z will be removed.
 *
 * For example:
 *   the function alphaOnly("this 1 is fun") should return the string: "thisisfun"
 *   the function alphaOnly("Take 2 for the Team!") should return the string: "TakefortheTeam" 
 */
function alphaOnly(str) {
  // Write your code here.
}
