# SIMPLE LOGIC

## Write a function stores numbers from 1 to 100 in an array.
```javascript
/**
Write a function stores numbers from 1 to 100 in an array.
**/
function oneToOneHundred() {
    // Write your code here.
}

var result = oneToOneHundred();
console.log("Should be equal to 100: " + result.length);
console.log("Should be a list of numbers from 1 to 100 => " + result);
```

## Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the smallest number.
```javascript
/**
 Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the smallest number.
 Parameter: @arr An array of numbers
 Return: The smallest number in @arr.
**/
function smallestNumber(arr) {
    // Write your code here.
}

console.log("Should be: 2 => " + smallestNumber([6,10,4,2]));
console.log("Should be: 10 => " + smallestNumber([90, 50, 40, 30, 10, 100]));
console.log("Should be: 13 => " + smallestNumber([13, 90, 100, 50, 63, 23, 14]));
console.log("Should be: 12 => " + smallestNumber([12, 12, 12, 12, 12]));
console.log("Should be: -1 => " + smallestNumber());
console.log("Should be: -1 => " + smallestNumber([]));
```

```javascript
/**
 * Write a function which, given a number (num), prints out a triangle made out of asterisks
 * where the bottom number of asterisks in the triangle is that number (num).
 * Example:
 *   if num = 3
 *     *
 *     **
 *     ***
 *   if num = 2:
 *     *
 *     **
 */
function printTriangle(num) {

}
 
printTriangle(3);
 ``` 

```javascript
/**
 * Write a function which will return an array of numbers which are divisible by 7 
 * but are not a multiple of 5, between the begin and end input variables (inclusive).
 */
function isDivisibleBy7Not5(beginNumber, endNumber) {

}
 
console.log("Should be: 7 => " + isDivisibleBy7Not5(1,10));
console.log("Should be: 7, 14 ,21, 28, 42, 49 => " + isDivisibleBy7Not5(1,50));
``` 

```javascript
Question 3

Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then print the multiplication table of that number. 
``` 
 
```javascript
Question 4

Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered through the keyboard. 
``` 

```javascript
Question 5

Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program to find the value of one number raised to the power of another. (Do not use Java built-in method)
``` 

```javascript
Question 6

Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.
``` 

```javascript
Question 7

Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.
``` 

```javascript
Question 8

Write a program that prompts the user to input a positive integer. It should then output a message indicating whether the number is a prime number. 
``` 

```javascript
Question 9

Write a program to calculate HCF of Two given number.
``` 

```javascript
Question 10

Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. If so, the loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate. 
``` 


Question 13

Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500. If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number.
For example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 )

``` 

Question 14

Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 ..... 

``` 

Question 15

Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + .... + 1/n 

``` 

Question 16

Compute the natural logarithm of 2, by adding up to n terms in the series
1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5 - ... 1/n
where n is a positive integer and input by user.

Question 19

Write a program to compute sinx for given x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the sine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xn

sin x = x - x3/3! + x5/5! - x7/7! + x9/9! .......

Question 20

Write a program to compute the cosine of x. The user should supply x and a positive integer n. We compute the cosine of x using the series and the computation should use all terms in the series up through the term involving xn

cos x = 1 - x2/2! + x4/4! - x6/6! .....
